	<p>The title of my video is "replacing a whole production team". Through the whole thing I go in depth on how I personally approach some of my bigger projects. The title itself is kind of an outcome of this mindset that I have. I believe that it is important to know all the skills that you have and to be able to present them in the best way possible. Once you have this package of skills it is very easy to convince your client to only only with you and not a whole team of people. My video describes this process more in-depth.</p>
