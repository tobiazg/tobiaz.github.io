<p> Underground is one of the words that I have a love-and-hate relationship with. On one side I feel like it is a beautiful word that can't really be replaced with any other. On the other side, I notice that people have this tendency to use the word in the wrong context all the time.
 To start this off I would like to describe why this word sometimes gets on my nerves. In today's age where everyone has such a wide and unlimited spectrum of information and media to consume every single day, no one is able to process everything that is going on in the art scene (this can be music, graffiti, movies, etc.). This divides us into these small bubbles that are defined by the artists we enjoy. It is very likely that the music that you listen to will be reflected not only in your playlists but also on your YouTube and Instagram feeds. Once the algorithm notices that you enjoy this one specific thing is sometimes hard to stay up to date with everything else going on in the art scene. This then creates this image in your head that the stuff that you see on your social media is the stuff that everyone else sees. I feel like a good example of this would be the recent conversations I had with one of my good friends. She is a huge Taylor Swift fan and I am not. To be honest I probably never heard a single album of hers. But at the same time, I recognize how much of a huge impact and a large following she has. My problem with the word underground in this conversation came up when she used the word to describe anything else that does not have millions of followers across all the platforms that we use. People tend to use the word underground very often for the stuff that they do not know. This is because the stuff that they do not know about is not showing up in their bubbles, therefore it must not be relevant, and therefore it must be known by a smaller audience.
 We should know that this is not the case of the word Underground. Underground is a great way to describe tendencies that go the opposite way when compared to the mainstream. Rejecting the motives that resonate with a larger audience. Very often not being driven by profit. And very often when we talk about underground art, it is staying authentic to its art form without the outside influence of others. I love this word, because it can describe a very specific form of approach towards art. there is not any other word that would fit the same criteria.
 In conclusion, not many people will be hurt or offended when this word is not used in the right context. But I believe that once a person learns what it actually means it is easier to look at art and media surrounding you.</p>
