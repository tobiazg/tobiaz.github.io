<h1>Voice, tone and style&nbsp;</h1>
	
	<p>Throughout the years I was able to create a small circle of very close friends. Some of these relationships last even longer than 17 years and we still talk on a daily basis. I would say that the key to a long-lasting friendship is being able to understand how to communicate with each person individually in a way that is comfortable for both of you. I apply this way of thinking even for my professional career. Each client and each project can turn out to be a great benefit for you, if you are able to communicate the appropriate way.</p>
	
<h2>Voice</h2>
	
	<p>Open/welcoming - If I see that a person that I talk to is very open about the topics that we are discussing, it somehow makes me feel more safe with them. If he brings up topics that are not normally discussed I see it as a sign to also be freely express myself. I like to be open to people if I want them to be open to me. If I am not interested in talking on a more personal level, I never open myself to them.</p>
	<p>Honest - Never in my life have I experienced a scenario where not being honest would be the right path. Therefore I'm always honest so that I do not have to ever explain myself twice.</p>
	
<h2>Tone</h2>
		
		<p>Appreciative - If anyone shows any kind of love towards me, I always make sure to reflect it. I do not only mean saying "thank you" but I also try to lead up to some form of appreciation maybe for the next time I see them. An example of this might just be remembering someone's favorite song and then sending them a different one that I feel like they could like too. The appreciation does not have to be immediate or even in the same conversation. I just find it important to be thankful and try to benefit others if they benefited me in the past.</p>
	<p>Dominant - This mostly applies to the more professional types of conversations that I have. The key for me is to always keep up with what is happening. I never want to be viewed as someone that is knowledged in my craft and I want the people that I work with to be aware of that.

</p>
<p>Funny - The only exception for this tone might be funerals and discussing payments. Other from that I think it is very important not to be always serious. Throughout my experience, I found it helpful to loosen up the atmosphere sometimes.

</p>
	
<h2>Style</h2>
		
	<p>To-the-point - No matter where or with who I am with, I do not enjoy small talk. If there is something important to discuss I do not see any benefits in postponing it. From my experience it was always a waist of time. If there is a heated discussion that is supposed to be had, it should happen now, so that everyone can move on.</p>
	<p>Understanding - It is very much fine to agree to disagree. It is always important to understand why you disagree with someone. I believe that showing that you are willing to understand is a very strong skill. But it is very important to see the difference between understanding and agreeing.

</p>
	<p>Not-being-shy - I was never shy as a kid and I would say that this is still the case. Trying to talk to a lot of people in a group or separately, can be very exhausting. On the other hand, I believe that having many different interactions and being exposed to many different ideas can only be beneficial for your overall personality. </p>
