	<p>The bachelor thesis explores the process of creating a new fashion brand. This process commences with the definition of fundamental concepts that will constitute the fashion brand and its visual identity. It further delves into the marketing segment, which is pivotal for business operations within the fashion industry. In the practical section of this bachelor thesis, the author draws upon insights from their own seven-year experience in the field and provides specific know-how for working with textile printing. These acquired experiences are later reflected upon in the conclusion of the thesis, where a proposal for the first collection of the newly established fashion brand is introduced. Beyond the marketing and visual focus of this work, the author extends into the issue of information overload and the transient nature of products in today's generation. This issue is later reflected upon in a satirical manner through the newly created brand of the fashion label.
