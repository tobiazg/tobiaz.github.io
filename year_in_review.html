<h1>Year in review</h1>
	
	<p>2024</p>
	<p>Tobias Groh</p>
	

	

	
<h2>School</h2>
	
	<p>This year school wasn't my main focus. I was able to attend all my classes and finish everything that was needed, but I can't say that I have learned a single useful thing or a skill. My mom wants me to finish university so I will do that.

</p>
	

<h2>Work</h2>
		
		<p>Outside of school, I have been working 24/7 on my own projects. Most of these were outside of the czech republic and the amount of experience i have gained from that is still surprising for me. Being able to work with foreign clients just based on my own creative ideas and skills is probably the best thing that has happened to me in the last 22 years of my life.</p>
	

<h2>Personal</h2>
		
<p>I have in a relationship for the last 4 years. I have friends that i love and through out the last year I have realised just how much important it is for me to be able to surround myself with the people that support everything I do.</p>
