	<p>For the last 10 years, I have been creating all kinds of visuals for more than 300 different clients. Projects for artists, musicians, brands, galleries, theaters, corporate companies, cinemas, schools, and myself.</p>
	
<h2>About me</h2>
	
	<p>I like to say that I create visuals. Not only that it sounds better than saying that I am an artist, but it also sums up all the products I can provide for my clients. The range of these products is quite wide. As of 2024, I can provide:

		<p>Documenting (video/photo) music shows is one of those things that got me the most publicity out of all the things that I provide.</p>
	
	
		
		<p>Video edits are mostly for brands or events that need online marketing.</p>
	
		
		<p>Music videos are probably the most demanded "product" right now. As of 2024, I have done 5 so far. </p>
	
		
		<p>Designing collections for fashion brands and overall making collaborations with brands that I personally enjoy might be my favorite form of "working".</p>
	
	

		
		<p>I started out with art and creating all sorts of things when I was very young. Throughout the years I discovered many different platforms through which I could spill out all the ideas I had on my mind. Whether it was photography or graffiti in my teens I always had this urge to create something. It is very hard to describe on paper or just put it into words. Probably the best way to describe it is with a rule that I created five years ago when I was 16. 
"Every single day something new has to be created"
There has not been a single day without obeying this one rule. Even when i was sick, in a hospital, abroad, sad, drunk... I made sure that every single day, I put out an idea that wasn't there before.</p>
